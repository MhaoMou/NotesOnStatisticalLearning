# NotesOnStatisticalLearning
In this repository, I put the notes about knowledge I learned by myself. Due to my weak knowledge, there might be many mistakes in the notes.

My current interests are on
- variational inference
- sampling methods
- causal inference
- Bayesian statistics


https://github.com/MhaoMou/NotesOnStatisticalLearning/blob/main/note1.pdf. In this note, I included `Expectation Maximization`, `Variational Expectation Maximization`, `Reparameterized Gradients through Rejection Sampling` and `Variational Sequential Monte Carlo`
https://github.com/MhaoMou/NotesOnStatisticalLearning/blob/main/Logic_Temporal_Point_Process.pdf. Logic temporal point processes, inference and applications (under construction)
https://github.com/MhaoMou/NotesOnStatisticalLearning/blob/main/BS1___Introduction.pdf. Introduction to Bayesian statistics. (under construction, it now contains brief introduction and Monte-Carlo methods)
https://github.com/MhaoMou/NotesOnStatisticalLearning/blob/main/note1%20(1).pdf， Statistical Learning Notes, mainly follows the book `Statistical Learning Methods` by Li Hang
